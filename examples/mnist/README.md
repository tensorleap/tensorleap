MNIST
=======

We show an example of building a cnn network trained on MNIST dataset.

This example includes the following steps:

- Loading MNIST dataset and do some very basic preprocessing
- Building a CNN network using tensorflow keras modules
- Sanity Check: test the (untrained) model prediction on one sample
- setting up Leap env
- integrate the model and dataset into the TL. (using leap cli)  


The project directory includes the following files:

- dataset.py: 
  
  - preprocessing utils funcs 
  - the functions we need for TL 

- mapping.py
- model.py: model implementation
