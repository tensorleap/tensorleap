# MNIST

1. *First, we need to build a model and we infer it on a sample for sanity check and ease the later use.*

We show an example of building a baseline cnn model trained on MNIST dataset.

This example includes the following steps:
- Loading MNIST dataset and do some very basic preprocessing
- Building CNN network using tensorflow keras modules and compile
- Sanity Check: predict the untrained network on one sample

2. *setting up Leap env*

...

After, setting up one can see in the project directory the following files:

- dataset.py:
- mapping.py
- model.py: here we implement the model initialization
- config.toml
